#1 Breweries per State
#By using the Brewery dataset, we grouped and counted the number of breweries in each state. 
#We found the state of Colorado with 47 breweries has the most breweries in the country.  DC, ND, South Dakota, 
#and West Virginia each with 1 brewery have the least number of breweries in the country.

#2 Merge Data
#We merged the brewery data with the beer data, merging on Brew_ID.  
#To do this we had to change the Brewery_id in the Beer dataset to Brew_ID.
